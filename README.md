Salary Calculator

## Description
This salary calculator takes user inputs of employee information and stores them in a table. As employee salaries are added, the monthly costs increase; conversely, when employees are removed from the list, the monthly cost total decreases by their salary amount. 

Decreasing the by salary amount was the most difficult challenge to overcome: but when I decided not to house the employee salaries in an array, and instead assign the salaries a class and total all items that share the same class, it became much easier. 

If the monthly budget of $20,000 is exceeded by employee salaries, the page will display a warning and change the total to red. 

All styling was accomplished with bootstrap.
